<b>My Library</b> is a place where you can easily keep track of the books you own.

You can:
  - add book
  - delete book
  - edit book
  - search books (by Title or Author)
  - filter books by genre
  - manage (create, rename, delete) genres
  
If you want to know more about a specific book, click on it and a panel will display info from Google Books API.

It's responsive so no worries clicking on your favourite gadget.

The project is ongoing, new functionalities are on the way...
